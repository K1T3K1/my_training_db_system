# YetAnotherSQLRDBMS

Hi and welcome to the repository. What You are witnessing is me, creating another RDBMS. It's a practice project for me to raise my C++ skills.

# First release goals

**Working RDMBS containing some of PostgreSQL abilities:** 
  1. **frontend-compiler** that can understand basic **DDL, DML, DQL** keywords: **SELECT, FROM, WHERE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP etc.**
  2. **relations** with columns of different types
  3. column **constraints**
  4. **persistence** to the hard-drive
  5. **password encryption**

# Future Goals
  1. **subqueries** handling
  2. sql **functions** (sum, coalesce etc.
  3. benchmarking and optimizations
